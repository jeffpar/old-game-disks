## PCjs Game Disk Archive

The [PCjs Game Disk Archive](https://github.com/jeffpar/old-games-disks) was a repository of disk images
for use as a submodule with the original [PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs).

Both of those repositories have been superseded by the new [PCjs Machines Repository](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs.org) and [PCjs Game Disk Repository](https://gamedisks.pcjs.org/).
